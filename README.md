## First Steps

### Setup

#### Steps

##### Grab the latest [release](https://github.com/hackerspace-bootstrap/strichliste/releases)

##### install dependencies

````bash
$ npm i
````

##### run tests

````bash
$ npm run test
````

##### initialize database

creates the tables in the sqlitefile

````bash
$ npm run setup:database
````

#### everything at once

For your convenience the following npm script does all of the above steps at once:
````bash
$ npm run setup
````

#### start api server

Consider editing the configuration before starting the api server (see the [configuration](#configuration) section).
````bash
$ npm run start
````

## Configuration

The API server brings with it a default configuration which can be found in `/configuration/default.js`. This default can be used to setup your own configuration.
The server utilizes the [configurations](https://www.npmjs.org/package/configurations) module from npm which does a staged modification of configurations. Initially the default config is loaded and then subsequent modifications are applied.

You can add your own environment specific configuration by adding e.g. a `production.js` to the configurations folder. When the server is started with the node environment `NODE_ENV` set to `production`, the default config is enhanced by your production config. You don't have to specify each and every key from `default.js`, the defaults are retained.

You also can specify an external configuration sitting on an arbitrary place in your system by assigning it via a command line parameter:

````bash
$ node server.js --externalconfig=/etc/opt/strichliste/myconfig.js
````

### Configuration details

This section explains the content of the default.json which can be modified by you as you wish

````javascript
module.exports = {
    //the server runs on this port
    port: 8080,

    //details to the database
    database: {
        //the engine that should be used, until now only sqlite is supported
        type: 'SQLITE',

        //(arbitrary) options to the database engine
        options: {
            filename: 'data.sqlite'
        }
    },

        }
    },

    //boundaries define values the apply to a user account or the transactions of auser
    boundaries: {
        account: {
            //the maximum amount that can be stored in a user's account (99999999 is equvalent to Inifinity)

            lower: -50
        },

## API Documentation

Every API answer has the Content-Type `application/json`.
Data that is posted to the API is always JSON as well.

### Pagination

At some endpoints the following queryparameters can be used to control the pagination of lists:

* `limit`: the number of items to show
* `offset`: the number of the first item in the list

Each of the paginated lists are of the following data structure:

````
{
  overallCount: <int>,
  limit: <int>,
  offset: <int>,
  entries: [<entry]
}
````

### Endpoints

#### GET /user

Returns the complete list of all users.
Each user is described via the following data structure:
````
{
  "id": <int>,
  "name": <string>,
  "mailAddress": <string>,
  "balance": <float>,
  "lastTransaction": <dateTime>,
  "countOfTransactions": <int>,
  "weightedCountOfPurchases": <int>,
  "activeDays": <int>
}
````

The parameters and the list structure of the `Pagination` section are used in this endpoint.

#### POST /user

Creates a new user.
To create a new user a name and an optional mailAddress has to be assigned via the following data structure.

````
{
    "name": <string>,
    "mailAddress": <string>

#### GET /transaction

Lists the latest transactions.
Each transaction has the following data structure:
````
{
  id: <int>,
  userId: <int>,
  createDate: <DateTime>,
  value: <float>,
  comment: <string>
}
````

Use the parameters and the list structure of the `Pagination` section to specify the list's structure.

#### GET /user/:userId

Returns one specific user.
The returned data structure correlates with the /user endpoint, additionally a list of the five last transactions is sent.
(See the /user/transaction section for a reference to the transaction data structure)

}
````
